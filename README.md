# Mini GameHub API

**Mini GameHub API** is the backend for an application where users can express their opinions and thoughts about certain video games. The API is built and optimized so that users can leave comments and ratings for specific games, but only admins can add new games.

---

## **Description**

This API allows:

-User management and authentication via JWT.
-Creating, listing, updating, and deleting games (with admin permissions for modifications).
-Adding reviews for games, with ratings and comments, limited to a single review per user per -game.
-Adding games to a 'Favorite' category (via toggle).
-Filtering, searching, and sorting games and reviews.
-Pagination for large results, optimizing performance.
-Caching system for faster response times using Redis.
-Automatic cache invalidation on game creation or deletion (via Django signals).

- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Filtering and Searching:** Django Filter, DRF Search & Ordering
- **Pagination:** DRF Pagination
- **Caching:** Redis + Django cache framework
- **Frontend (coming soon...):** React.js + TailwindCSS (fullstack)

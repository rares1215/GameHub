# Mini GameHub API

**Mini GameHub API** is the backend for an application where users can express their opinions and thoughts about certain video games. The API is built and optimized so that users can leave comments and ratings for specific games, but only admins can add new games.

---

## **Description**

This API allows:

- User management and authentication via JWT.
- Creating, listing, updating, and deleting games (with admin permissions for modifications).
- Adding reviews for games, with ratings and comments, limited to a single review per user per game.
- Adding games to a **"Favorite"** category (via toggle).
- Filtering, searching, and sorting games and reviews.
- Pagination for large results, optimizing performance.
- Caching system for faster response times using **Redis**.
- Automatic cache invalidation on game or favorite creation/deletion (via Django signals).
- Request throttling system to prevent abuse and ensure API stability.
- Full unit testing coverage for core endpoints (Games, Reviews).

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Backend:** Django 5, Django REST Framework
- **Architecture:** ViewSets + Routers for cleaner RESTful design
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Filtering and Searching:** Django Filter, DRF Search & Ordering
- **Pagination:** DRF Pagination
- **Caching:** Redis + Django cache framework
- **Frontend (coming soon...):** React.js + TailwindCSS (fullstack)
- **Throttling:** Custom rate-limiting using DRF throttling classes (`BurstRateThrottle`, `SustainedRateThrottle`)
- **Testing:** Django REST Framework built-in test suite (`APITestCase`)

---

## **Main Endpoints**

- **Users & Auth**

  - `/api/register/` - Create account
  - `/api/token/` - Obtain JWT token
  - `/api/token/refresh/` - Refresh token
  - `/api/profile/` - Get authenticated user profile

- **Games**

  - `/api/games/` - List and create games (POST for admin)
  - `/api/games/<game_id>/` - Retrieve, Update, Delete game (Update/Delete for admin)

- **Reviews**

  - `/api/games/<game_id>/reviews/` - List and create reviews
  - `/api/reviews/<review_id>/` - Retrieve, Update, Delete review (update/delete only by owner)

- **Favorites**
  - `/api/favorites/` - List user favorites
  - `/api/games/<game_id>/favorite/` - Toggle favorite (add/remove game from favorites)

---

## **Advanced Features**

- **Ordering:** Games and reviews can be ordered by relevant data (e.g., release date, average rating, number of reviews).
- **Filtering:** Support for filtering games and reviews by various criteria (genre, developer, rating, etc.).
- **Searching:** Text search in title and developer.
- **Pagination:** Limits the number of results per page for optimal performance.
- **Performance:** Optimizations using `select_related` and `prefetch_related` to reduce SQL queries.
- **Caching:** Game list results are cached for 15 minutes in Redis for faster performance.
- **Cache Invalidation:** Implemented via Django signals (post_save, post_delete) to ensure up-to-date data.
- **Throttling** Custom burst and sustained throttling policies:
  - `burst`: limits short-term rapid requests.
  - `sustained`: controls long-term request volume.
  - Implemented with DRF‚Äôs `UserRateThrottle` + Redis backend.
- **Testing** Comprehensive unit test coverage using Django REST Framework‚Äôs test suite.
- Tests include:
  - CRUD operations for Games and Reviews.
  - Permission logic for admins and users.
  - Business rules (e.g., one review per game).
  - Database state validation after create/update/delete.

**The application will be a Full-Stack app. The API will continue to evolve (throttling, etc.). This is a work in progress.**
